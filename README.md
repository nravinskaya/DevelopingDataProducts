This is my course project "Shiny Application and Reproducible Pitch" for the Coursera class "Developing Data Products" in *Data Science specialization* offered by *Johns Hopkins University*.
According to the terms of the assignment, the project has two parts, namely, I have to:  
1. create a Shiny application and deploy it on Rstudio's servers 
2. use Rstudio Presenter to prepare a reproducible pitch presentation about my application.

My **Shiny Application** must satisfy the following:
- in question is entirely up to me
- simple for the end user
- contains instructions on what the user needs to get started with it
- must include:
	- some form of input (widget: textbox, radio button, checkbox, ...)
	- some operation on the ui input in sever.R
	- some reactive output displayed as a result of server calculations
	- enough documentation (should be at the Shiny website itself)  

My **Reproducible Pitch Presentation** must be:
- done in Rstudio Presenter
- 5 pages (inclusive of the title slide)
- hosted on github  

It must also contain some embedded R code that got evaluated and displayed.

**I have to share:** 
- the link to my Shiny application (https://nravinskaya.shinyapps.io/devdatprodapp/)
- the link to my github presentation (http://nravinskaya.github.io/DevelopingDataProducts/index.html)
- my server.R and ui.R code on github (https://github.com/nravinskaya/DevelopingDataProducts/tree/gh-pages/app)
