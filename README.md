This is my course project "Shiny Application and Reproducible Pitch" for the Coursera class "Developing Data Products" in *Data Science specialization* offered by *Johns Hopkins University*.
According to the terms of the assignment, the project has two parts, namely, I have to:  
1. create a Shiny application and deploy it on Rstudio's servers 
2. use Rstudio Presenter to prepare a reproducible pitch presentation about my application.

My **Shiny Application** must satisfy the following:
- in question is entirely up to me
- simple for the end user
- contains instructions on what the user needs to get started with it
- must include:
	1. some form of input (widget: textbox, radio button, checkbox, ...)
	2. some operation on the ui input in sever.R
	3. some reactive output displayed as a result of server calculations
	4. enough documentation (should be at the Shiny website itself) 
I have to share: 
- the application link
- my server.R and ui.R code on github

My **Reproducible Pitch Presentation** must be:
- done in Rstudio Presenter
- 5 pages (inclusive of the title slide)
- hosted on github
It must contain some embedded R code (an R expression) that got evaluated and displayed.
